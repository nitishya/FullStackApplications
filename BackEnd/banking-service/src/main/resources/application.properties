# Spring Boot Application Name
# This is the name of the Spring Boot application, useful for identifying the application in logs or monitoring systems.
spring.application.name=banking-service

# Hibernate DDL Auto Configuration
# Defines the behavior of Hibernate for schema generation.
# 'update' will automatically update the database schema to match the model. This is fine for development, 
# but should be set to 'none' or 'validate' in production to avoid unwanted schema changes.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# DataSource Configuration
# Database URL (Make sure the MySQL database is running on localhost:3306 with 'bankdb' as the database name)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankdb

# Database Username (Here 'root' is used, but should be changed to a non-root user in production)
spring.datasource.username=root

# Database Password (Again, using 'root' here, but ensure this is secure in production)
spring.datasource.password=root

# Show SQL Queries in Logs (Helpful for debugging during development)
# Set this to 'false' in production to prevent exposing sensitive data in logs.
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# JWT Secret Key (Used to sign and validate JWT tokens)
# Make sure this secret is kept safe. Consider storing it in an environment variable for production.
jwt.secret=MySecretKey12345

# JWT Expiration Time (Set in milliseconds)
# This value represents how long a JWT will be valid. 
# For example, 86400000 milliseconds = 1 day.
jwt.expiration=86400000

# Disable the default user and password generation
spring.security.user.name=none
spring.security.user.password=none

# JTA Platform Configuration for JDBC-based transactions (if you're not using JTA)
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.transaction.jta.platform=org.hibernate.engine.transaction.internal.jdbc.JdbcTransactionFactory

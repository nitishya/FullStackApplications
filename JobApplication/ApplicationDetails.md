Components Breakdown:

1. Angular Frontend:
Admin Interface: A page for the admin to add new job postings.
Fields: Title, Description, Location, Requirements, etc.
Candidate Interface: A page for candidates to apply to a job.
Fields: Name, Email, Resume URL, Job Selection.
Submit Button: A submit button on the candidate form that sends the application to the backend and triggers the email.
Services: Angular services will handle HTTP requests to communicate with the backend APIs.
2. Spring Boot Backend:
Job Module:
Admin adds job posts.
Jobs are stored in the Job table.
Admin can list all job postings for candidates to apply to.
Job Application Module:
A candidate submits their application (name, email, resume URL, job ID).
Applications are stored in the JobApplication table.
A method to trigger the email sending process to notify HR.
Email Service:
Upon application submission, an email is sent to HR with candidate details (using Spring's JavaMailSender).
REST API:
/api/jobs (GET) to fetch job listings.
/api/jobs (POST) to add new jobs (admin only).
/api/applications (POST) to submit a job application.
3. MySQL Database:
Tables:
Job: Stores job details (id, title, description, location, requirements).
JobApplication: Stores application details (id, candidate name, email, resume URL, job id).
Relationships:
The JobApplication table will have a foreign key reference to the Job table (job ID).
4. Email Notification System:
Email Sending: After a candidate submits their application, the backend will send an email (via JavaMailSender).
Email Content: The email will contain the candidate's details (name, email, job title, etc.) and a link to the resume.
Data Flow (When a Candidate Applies for a Job)
Candidate submits the application via Angular form (name, email, job ID, resume URL).
Angular sends a POST request to the Spring Boot backend (API /api/applications).
The backend validates and saves the application in the JobApplication table.
The Email Service triggers, sending an email to HR with the candidate's details.
HR receives an email with the applicant's information, including their resume link.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript.
Backend: Spring Boot, Java, Spring Data JPA, Spring Mail.
Database: MySQL.
Email: SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).
DevOps (optional): Docker, Jenkins for CI/CD, etc.
Key Considerations:
Authentication & Authorization: If needed, secure the admin functionalities using Spring Security (e.g., admin login).
Email Service: Set up email credentials securely, use an SMTP provider like Gmail, SendGrid, or any custom email service.
Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling for invalid form submissions and email failures.
Frontend Validation: Add client-side validation for required fields (e.g., candidate name, email, resume URL) using Angular forms.
Responsive UI: Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to ensure the UI is responsive.
With this architecture, you have a clear separation between the frontend and backend, the ability to manage jobs and applications, and a seamless process for candidates to apply while notifying HR via email.
